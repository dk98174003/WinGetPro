# WinGetPro

WinGetPro is a simple, single-window Tkinter application for managing Windows software through the WinGet command-line tool. 

It lets you search for packages, view installed apps, and see which apps have upgrades available. 

From the same page you can install, upgrade, or uninstall selected packages, and you can “pin” packages to exclude them from bulk upgrades (and unpin them later). 

The Search field also works as a live filter in the Installed and Upgrades views, and the result list supports column sorting by clicking the headers.
